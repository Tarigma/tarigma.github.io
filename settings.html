                    In 2018, the NERC issued the State of Reliability
                    Report for 2012-2017 which documented that
                    forty percent (40%) of the misoperations of grid
                    protection systems are the result of human
                    error; specifically, protection relay settings
                    being in an incorrect state. Thirty percent
                    (30%) of the mis-operations were due to
                    incorrect logic, engineering calculations, or
                    errors in settings entry, and a full ten percent
                    (10%) result from a failure to restore the
                    production settings after testing is complete.

                    Tarigmaâ€™s Relay Settings Management (RSM)
                    feature provides periodic collection of relay
                    settings from Substation IEDs across the grid,
                    comparison to their design baseline, and notification
                    of P&C Engineers via email and/or SMS
                    when differences are detected.

                    RSM also detects when relays are placed in Test
                    Mode and alerts Engineers if test settings are
                    still present after testing is complete. Our white
                    paper demonstrates a 5 to 8 times Return-On-
                    Investment (ROI) for RSM over a ten-year
                    period.
