                <p class="text-left">Since 1991, Tarigma Corporation has developed and marketed software that supplies
                    accurate, timely, and hard-to-acquire data to the mission-critical processes and applications that
                    global companies depend on. Throughout the decade that birthed the Internet for commercial and
                    industrial exploitation, Tarigma mastered the communication protocols that allowed wildly-different
                    systems to be connected, and to share data and directives. Tarigma has been particularly active and
                    successful with global leaders in Process &amp; Discrete Manufacturing and Power, Gas &amp; Water
                    Utilities. <a href="/#industries">Learn more about Tarigma markets and customers.</a></p>
                <p class="text-left">In the decade after Y2K, Tarigma helped its clients remediate vulnerable
                    communication links, implement tighter security policies, and exploit the demand for real-time data
                    access across the enterprise. And all this as new and evolving industry-standard protocols for
                    communication and interoperability crossed the IT landscape.</p>
                <p class="text-left">By the dawn of the current decade, a sea change in Information Technology was
                    underway: the abandonment of the “asset purchase” model for hardware, software and facilities
                    that become technologically obsolete well before their depreciation schedules expire, and the
                    adoption of a new “subscription service” model called Cloud Computing. And this move to the
                    Cloud coincided with another megatrend: the expansion of software applications into Business
                    Analytics and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
                <p class="text-left">So just as Computing is moving to <b>The Cloud</b> and farther away from its
                    data sources, it is developing a growing appetite for exponentially more data from the remote
                    recesses of the enterprise, or what some now call <b>The Edge</b>. This creates traffic,
                    consumes bandwidth, and increases latency on the network, thereby slowing the response to
                    critical events. Tarigma recognized this problem decades ago thanks to its experiences with
                    supervisory control loops in manufacturing applications and implemented its software using a
                    distributed network architecture which places data collection, time stamping and event-framing
                    modules as close to the data sources as possible, and uses transaction caching to insure data
                    reaches its central destination in context despite slow or disrupted networks. Now important
                    leaders in Information Technology (Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, etc.) have addressed these problems
                    by creating a distributed network reference architecture called <b>Fog Computing</b> to promote
                    open standards that drive innovation and interoperability. Tarigma continues to innovate using
                    the principles of Fog Computing. <a href="/technology">Learn more about Tarigma technology. </a>
